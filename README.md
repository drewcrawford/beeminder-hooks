# What is this

A simple way to track your commits in [Beeminder](https://www.beeminder.com).  I don't like their GitHub integration becase A) I don't always use GitHub, B) I don't like only tracking the [master branch](https://www.beeminder.com) and C) giving somebody access to my private repos isn't really necessary.

# How do you do it

First, create a Beeminder goal called "commits".

Clone this repo, run install.sh.  Then run "git init" in all your repos.
